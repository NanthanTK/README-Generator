  # README_Generator

  
  ## Description

  Many developers are busy with creating the applications. However, a well structured set of information adds value to the application.

This application makes that task easy by creating the README.md from the the developers.

It prompts the developers for the necessary information for the different sections and based on the input, it creates the README file. 

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
